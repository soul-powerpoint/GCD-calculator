# GCD-calculator

The Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

Key Idea of the Euclidean Algorithm:
The GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its remainder when divided by the smaller number. This process is repeated until the remainder becomes zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
